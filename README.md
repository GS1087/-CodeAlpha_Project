Project Name: Titanic Survival Prediction

Description:

This project tackles the fascinating challenge of predicting passenger survival on the infamous RMS Titanic disaster, leveraging the power of machine learning. We explore the influence of key factors like socio-economic status (Pclass), age, and gender on survival outcomes.

Purpose:

Historical Exploration: Gain insights into factors that potentially influenced survival rates on the Titanic.
Machine Learning Practice: Explore using machine learning models for classification tasks and understand their limitations.
Data Analysis Fundamentals: Employ data analysis techniques like feature engineering, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
Key Functionalities:

Data Preprocessing:

Data Loading: Load the Titanic dataset (e.g., from CSV).
Missing Value Handling: Address missing values in the dataset using appropriate strategies (e.g., imputation, removal).
Feature Engineering: Create new features if necessary (e.g., family size, title categories from name).
Data Encoding: Encode categorical features (e.g., Pclass, Sex) using suitable techniques (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).
Data Splitting: Divide the data into training and testing sets for model creation and evaluation.
Model Selection and Training:

Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning models for classification (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine).
Model Training: Train the models on the prepared training data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV for better performance.
Model Evaluation:

Performance Metrics: Evaluate model performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
Visualization: Consider using visualization techniques (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC curve) to gain deeper understanding.
Comparison: Compare the performance of different models to choose the best option.
Prediction:

User Input: Allow users to input passenger characteristics (Pclass, age, gender, etc.).
Prediction Generation: Utilize the trained model to predict the probability of survival for the entered information.
Disclaimer: Emphasize that the model provides an estimate, not a guaranteed outcome.
Note:

It's crucial to acknowledge the limitations of this project and real-world prediction. The Titanic dataset reflects a snapshot in time and may not perfectly generalize to different scenarios.
