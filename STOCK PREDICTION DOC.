Project Name: Stock Price Prediction with LSTMs

Description:

This project delves into the realm of stock price prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a powerful tool in deep learning for handling sequential data like time series. We'll explore how LSTMs can learn long-term dependencies in historical stock prices to generate forecasts for future values.

Prerequisites:

Basic understanding of Python programming
Familiarity with Jupyter Notebook
Working knowledge of fundamental machine learning concepts (optional)
Required Libraries:

pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
numpy: Numerical computations
matplotlib: Visualization
tensorflow or pytorch: Deep learning frameworks (we'll use tensorflow here)
sklearn.preprocessing: Data preprocessing (optional)
